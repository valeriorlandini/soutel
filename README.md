* `utils.h` Miscellaneous utility functions, such as unit conversions, zero padding, etc.
* `window_functions.h` A series of window functions
* `wtosc.h` Wavetable oscillator

These classes are designed to be used in real-time audio applications, such as digital audio workstations, plugins, or live coding environments. They can also be used for offline sound synthesis and processing. The library is header-only, so you can simply include the desired header files in your project and start using the classes. No external dependencies are required, except for the C++ standard library and a C++ compiler that supports at least C++14, even if C++20 is recommended and necessary for some specific features.

### Tutorial

To use the classes from this library, simply include the corresponding file(s). For example, let's create a bandlimited oscillator and filter its output using a lowpass filter.

First, include the necessary files and import the namespace:
```cpp
#include "blosc.h"
#include "biquad.h"
     
using namespace soutel;
```

Next, instantiate the classes, providing optional arguments as needed:
```cpp
BLOsc<double> oscillator(44100.0, 440.0); // Arguments: sample rate and frequency
Biquad<double> filter(44100.0, 880.0, 2.0, 1.0, BQFilters::lowpass);  // Arguments: sample rate, cutoff frequency, Q factor, gain (for shelving filters), filter type
```

Finally, call the `run()` function. For the bandlimited oscillator, which can produce different waveforms, you can either specify the desired waveform or pass variables to capture all the available shapes:
```cpp
oscillator.run(); // Alternatively, pass four variables to run() to store the sine, triangle, saw, and square wave outputs
double filtered_sample = filter.run(oscillator.get_saw());
```

A more detailed tutorial is coming sometime soon. In the meanwhile, you can check how many of these classes are implemented in Max/MSP objects in my open source package [sonus](https://github.com/valeriorlandini/sonus).
